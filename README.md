Sign Language Recognition Project
This project is a real-time sign language recognition application designed to assist communication through visual gesture recognition. The project uses a machine learning model trained to detect various sign language gestures, a WebRTC-based video streaming setup for capturing live video, and a clean web interface for ease of use.

Features
Real-time Video Streaming: Uses WebRTC to capture and process video data in real time, allowing users to sign in front of their webcam.
Sign Language Recognition: Detects specific gestures based on trained machine learning models.
User-friendly Interface: Clean web interface that displays recognized gestures and their corresponding meanings.
Efficient Model Integration: Seamless integration of the machine learning model with a responsive web frontend.
Compatibility Across Devices: Works on desktops and laptops with webcam support.

Technologies Used
Python: For training the machine learning model and data preprocessing.
TensorFlow/Keras: Framework for building and training the gesture recognition model.
JavaScript (WebRTC): For real-time video capture and streaming.
Flask/Django: Backend framework to serve the application.
React/Vue: Frontend framework for the user interface.
HTML/CSS: Structure and styling of the web interface.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-recognition
cd sign-language-recognition
Install Dependencies:

Ensure Python and Node.js are installed.
Install backend dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install frontend dependencies:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Set up WebRTC:

Ensure your webcam has permission in your browser or operating system settings.
Configure WebRTC settings in webrtc-config.js.
Prepare the Model:

Download or train the model and save it in the models directory.
Specify the model path in config.py.
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
# Backend
python app.py

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm start
Access the Application:

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
Usage
Open the Application: Once the application is running, navigate to the local server link in your browser.
Enable Webcam: Grant permission for the application to access your webcam.
Start Signing: Begin using sign language gestures in front of your camera. The recognized gestures will be displayed in real-time on the screen.
View Translations: See real-time translations or gesture interpretations below the video stream.
Configuration
WebRTC Configuration:
Adjust webrtc-config.js to fine-tune video quality, latency, and frame rate.
ML Model Configuration:
Update model-related parameters (e.g., input shape, confidence threshold) in config.py.
Model Training
Dataset
Collect and preprocess sign language gestures for training.
Store labeled data in the data directory.
Training
Train the model with:
bash
Copy code
python train.py
Evaluate and save the model in models/.
For more details, refer to the train.py documentation.

Future Enhancements
Add More Signs: Expand the vocabulary of recognized gestures.
Mobile Support: Develop a mobile-friendly version for broader accessibility.
Improved Model Accuracy: Experiment with different model architectures and training datasets.
Real-time Feedback: Incorporate feedback to help users learn proper gestures.
